      Lili <br>
        • 95% of production was shut for 1 week, with most back online by mid-October. <br>
        • Some refineries could not get crude feedstock and had to shut down/reduce output.<br>
        • The government lent out oil from the strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) to help alleviate this issue and prevent refineries from closing.<br>
        • RBOB outperformed HO since September 2002 was warmer than average, allowing for a slightly extended driving season, while delaying demand for heating oil.<br>
      <br>
      Claudette<br>
        • 21% of production in the gulf was shut, but was restored quickly.<br>
        • Gasoline peaked prior to the storm making landfall, while crude and heating oil peaked 1 day after landfall.<br>
        • Gasoline (RB) showed a greater performance than heating oil (HO) because it was summer time.<br>
      <br>
      'Ivan the Terrible'<br>
        • Eight refineries were shut, and four were partially closed.<br>
        • Submarine mudslides destroyed crude pipelines, so oil rigs couldn't restart production until these pipelines were found, repaired, and reinstalled.<br>
        • Refiners struggled to get crude feedstock, and ended up getting a loan from the SPR.<br>
        • Oil and product prices extended their gains for 26 days after the hurricane made landfall despite the SPR loans.<br>
        • Other factors affecting this were a pipeline explosion in Iraq and an oil tanker explosion in Siberia.<br>
        • HO outperformed RBOB as the market was predicting the cooler winter ahead (winter was 3.2 degrees F below average for the Northeast, the main market for heating oil).<br>
     <br>
      Dennis<br>
        • 96% of production was shut with minimal damage, and no refineries were closed.<br>
        • This was because Dennis ended up tracking 30 miles east of Ivan, leading to minimal imapct.<br>
        • Crude and product prices peaked prior to landfall due to the latter.<br>
        • RBOB outperformed HO because it was summer time.<br>
      <br>
      Katrina<br>
        • 92% of gulf production was shut-in, and at least 9 refineries were shut down in Louisiana/Mississippi.<br>
        • Crude oil prices were not affected since the government was lending at from the SPR as early as September 3rd.<br>
        • Massive destruction of oil infrastructure led to a longer impact (see shut-in production graph).<br>
        • RBOB outperformed HO because the storm hit before the end of driving season.<br>
      <br>
      Rita<br>
        • All of gulf production was shut-in, and 20 Texas refineries were closed. <br>
        • Had a smaller impact on product prices than Katrina, which is surprising given that Texas had (and still does have) the most refining capacity in the area. <br>
        • RBOB outperformed HO, as September 2005 ended up being the warmest since 1961 in the Northeast (so heating oil demand would be delayed). The rest of the country 
        also experienced higher than average temperatures, so the driving season was extended for the entire country.<br>
        • The longer impact on production contributed to strong rallies in crude and product prices during the summer of 2006.<br>

      </p>
      <p>It's amazing how these two are correlated so closely, but its simple: more dollars means the dollar is worth less,
        so the price of gold goes up (as the supply of gold is relatively fixed).

      <b>9/23/2025 Gasoline Trade</b> <a target="_blank" href="reports/Oil Trade.pdf">Link</a>
      <p>On April 10th wrote a very short pitch on longing gasoline futures.  </p>
      <p>
        The catalysts were:
        - 3% reduction in operating capacity from refinery cuts
        - Lower initial crack spreads will force lower initial utilization rates; not meeting demand
      </p>
      <p>
        Risks I noted were:
        - OPEC supply increases drags both gasoline and crude lower
        - Early interest rate hikes or hawkish Fed statement
       </p>
      <p>
        The biggest factor behind the pitch, however was RBOB making a head and shoulders bottom. Gasoline ended up hitting 2.12 in the proper time
        period, but missed the 2.20 objective. This still would have been a ~8% return if I would have exited at the right time. Attached original document above.

      <p>Drivers of the price of gold in 2024 and my thoughts of what may happen this year. </p>

      <b>1/2/2025 RUB-USD Exchange rate history 1880-1917</b>
      <p style="text-align:center; font-size:8px;">
        <img src="images/RUB-USD_history.png" alt="chart" width=75% height=1%>
      </p>
      <p>Russia remained on the gold standard from 1896 until 1914 which kept RUB-USD stable
        (except for slight fluctuations which are probably from changes in the money supply -
        compare the M1 chart vs the longer term chart to see what I mean).
        Russia left the gold standard in 1914 since a new war would mean drawdowns in gold reserves (as in the 1905
        war).
        This would would leave them unable to support the gold standard, especially if there were a run on gold.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align:center; font-size:8px;">
        <img src="images/debtgdp.png" alt="chart" width=75% height=1%>
      </p>

      <p>
        Prior to the war, debt as a percent of GDP was high (48%), but not as much as other major powers such as France
        (66%).
        However, this went up during the war as debt multiplied and economic activity collapsed, two catalysts in the
        decline
        of the Ruble. Industrial production fell close to 90% and rail traffic fell by 60% during the war period.
        80% of factories were taken over for the war effort, leaving most production to be destroyed (as this is what
        happens
        with military equipment/supplies).
      </p>

      <p>Other catalysts driving the downfall of the Ruble include:</p>
      <p> (a) Large amounts of investments and debt held by foreigners (most notably the French) leaving the Ruble
        vulnerable to a
        pullback in foreign capital </p>
      <p>(b) Suspension of the gold standard, money printing to finance the war and subsequent monetary inflation. </p>
      <p>(c) General economic catastrophe: the numbers do not do the collapse justice - this was a time of shortages,
        higher mortality rates, and social unrest; to name a few. These are conditions which made it easy for a
        populist leader (Lenin) to take advantage of the situation and gain power. </p>
      <p style="text-align:center; font-size:8px;">
        <img src="images/rub1419.png" alt="chart" width=75% height=1%> <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        During the war, battle outcomes seemed to have a significant impact on the exchange rate. However, the Ruble
        took
        its biggest header in the fall of 1917, after the Tsar had abdicated and their was widespread social upheaval.
        The Rich that were able to get out of the country before their deposits were seized by Lenin were likely
        exchanging
        their Rubles for other currencies at any rate (very low) they could, adding pressure to the currency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another interesting trend is the increase in the exchange rate following the repudiation of Russian debts by
        Lenin.
        The most likely explanation seems to be that any investors who wanted to get out (everyone) had gotten out
        already,
        leaving little downside for the Ruble.

      <b>1/2/2025 EURUSD Drivers</b>
      <p style="text-align:center; font-size:8px;">
        <img src="images/EURUSD.png" alt="chart" width=75% height="1%">
      </p>
      <p>
        What seems to be the main driver of the EUR-USD exchange rate: relative inflation. From March thru August, US core CPI 
        fell relative to Eurozone core CPI. This and anticipation of Fed rate cuts brought US yields down, and helped the Euro to 
        rise relative to the dollar over the period. This movement stagnated in August, and in September, the Fed cut rates and 
        inflation increased and remained stubborn (core has been at 3.3% for past 3 months, and headline has risen to 2.7%). 
        Investors were and still are concerned about whether inflation is really on track to 2%, which seems to be the big reason 
        why yields and the dollar have surged over the period (including other related reasons, such as policy from the new president 
        and potentially even realignment of the beta of US debt). While headline has also increased in the Eurozone, there is still a 
        big difference in relative inflation rates that will have to keep policy tighter in the US relative to eurozone. It appears we 
        should see a stronger dollar until the inflation differential decreases more. We should see an exceptionally stronger dollar if 
        the differential were to rise again from any developments in the new year. The Fed has also signaled a more hawkish stance at 
        their last meeting, which supports this theme.

      <p>As you can see in the chart above up until roughly 1550, England suffered from stagnant prices, with Malthus'
        theory of population holding true.
        One factor in this turning around was the reversal of some usury laws in England in 1545, where they set a
        'legal maximum rate' as opposed
        to the prohibition that was set forth in 1275, based on the church doctrine of the time. The allowance of
        lending/banking would ultimately would ultimately
        start picking up livings standards and innovation as consumer demand and access to capital increased. This
        increased capital access to innovators probably would
        lead to inventions such as the steam engine, etc. This would play into the industrial revolution and the
        transformation of the world to the way we know it
        now. It seems that we have to give a big thanks to the reversal of that law!

      <b>10-15-2023 Financial Crisis Correlation in Russia</b>
      <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/willinfante/MarketR">Link</a>
      <p>Search historical stock data to find a historical trend closest to the bubble during 2005-2007 in the Russian
        stock market.
        Will likely be expanded soon to include multiple countries as cross references(US, UK, RUS, etc.) to predict
        future stock prices
        given the magnitude of current trends. Using Python, I was able to scan through roughly 600 sections of past
        stock prices and utilize
        compare each to the period Jan-2005 - Dec 2007 utilizing euclidean distance. I programmed it to compare each of
        those sections to
        the current period and return whichever combination of the two were the three shortest euclidean distances, with
        surprising results.
        The program returned the period August 1866 through June 1869 as closest to the current period.</p>

      <img src="images/chart.png" alt="chart" width=100% height="350">
      <p>In Russian history, there was a recession in 1870-1871, as reflected in the chart which falls at the same time
        as the 2008-2009 recession
        happened. One important difference to note is the higher magnitude of change in 2005-2007 vs the historical
        period. This is clearly due to the
        the absence of high frequency traders and the small amount of people owning stocks in the 1800s. Therefore,
        comparing the two still has significance.
        If one had done this model in June 2007, with russian rates held steady at 6.5%, it would not have been an
        unambiguous decision to short the market.
        These two time periods, while correlated, still hold differences in inputs. However, one input that is not very
        different is human psychology, which
        hasn't changed a whole lot in the past 200 years, with people following the herd in almost everything they do
        now and then. While it would have been
        unambiguous that the market was getting high and that I dropdown was probably due within the next few years, the
        hardest thing to determine is exactly
        how high a bubble will go! In 2007, it would have been unambiguous that the bubble in the US was going to come
        to an end given that vast amount of
        unregulated securities being issued in the United States. However in Russia, crude prices were still strong in
        June 2007, meaning that it would
        have been unwise to immediately short the market following this indicator. It would have been useful to look at
        the extreme bubble in the United States,
        which had ripple effects on the crude prices which was a key driver in the russian recession of 2009. GDP in
        Russia went up in 2007/2008, and
        the market dipped (likely due to decreased expectations of future preformance, which came to light in 2009 with
        the collapse in oil prices) but held up.
        Therefore, it would have been wise to short the Russian stock market in late mid-late 2008; which you would have
        done unambiguously if one was able
        to accuratly project a drop in crude prices (which in hindsight seems easy, but in reality it would have been
        difficult but not impossible). Speaking more broadly,
        every bubble must come to an end, but the question is when. In any bubble, if one is able to see how high the
        bubble is relative to historical
        measures and mesaure how strong the inputs are that are driving these changes, one would have a good grasp on
        whether the bubble would get as big as or bigger than
        historical bubbles. Another inicator I will work on soon is one in which a long term trend line is extrapolated
        across the S&P 500, recording the highest and lowest std. deviations in the set while comparing that to the std.
        deviation of the present. A model like this combined with an analysis of the strength in inputs driving the ups
        and downs of the market
        would be helpful in projected future market movements, along with the model used above. Overall, while this tool
        is very valuable, one must also compare inputs
        driving the trends in order to verify there significance in any trade. See python code in link. </p>
